if you have laravel don't install all files go to files how i write codes inside  
///////
The files is:

Models / Post.php    

Controllers/ PostController.php 
    
database/Migration/ 2022_07_12_120456_create_post_tbl.php
         
routes/ web.php
                  
 resources/ views/ posts/ (all blade files) 

 / // don't forget to migrate
